# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I've built this prework study guide in order to gain knowledge about how HTML, CSS, JS, and github all work and be able to show my understanding.
My main motivation for doing so was to show I'm able to start this course and can prove to myself that I'm able to understand all this new terminology and technology.
This project is to house some notes I've taken during the creation of this stuy guide, and as measuring stick I can look back at aftwards to see how much I have learnt and improved.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You use this by opening the webpage and viewing each section to see my notes on HTML, CSS, JS and Git.
If you open your dev tools on your browser of choice (it doesnt have to be chrome, other browsers also have dev tools), you can see the javascript I have implemented. This will show the topics I've covered and gives a random result of what to study next.
